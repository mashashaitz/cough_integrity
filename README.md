## Cough Integrity Module
#### [Vocalis Health](https://vocalishealth.com) Data Science Internship Project
This project is an instalment of a **cough validity classifier** for COVID-19 voice testing product. The classifier rejects cough-recordings with either:
* two little cough, or
* loud background noise.

The project is divided in three sections with corresponding folders:
  1. The code that set up the cough validation ML-algorithm,
  2. The cough integrity module for the COVID-19 voice testing product,
  3. Testing and research notebooks.

###### All audio-data, embeddings and ML-models cannot be published, shared or distributed in compliance with the NDA agreement.
