#### Cough Validation Module

An instalment of a **cough validity module** for COVID-19 voice testing product. The module is based on a classifier that rejects cough-recordings with either:
* two little cough, or
* loud background noise.

This module is based on preprocessed ~4000 audios from 6 different sources and it improved the filtering quality of the product by 20%. The audio preprocessing involves translation into embeddings.

###### Due to NDA-related concerns no embeddings or audios can be distributed or published.
